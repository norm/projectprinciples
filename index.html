<h3>A mutable rule can be made immutable</h3>

<p><em>First retrospective:</em> In any retrospective, a suggestion can be raised to
transmute a mutable rule to immutable in the next retrospective. This
suggestion is accepted with a positive majority vote.</p>

<p><em>Second retrospective:</em> Following a successful vote, a proper discussion
happens in the next retrospective with arguments for why this rule needs to be
protected beyond normal. After discussion, the team votes.</p>

<p><em>After voting:</em> Only with unanimous consent is the rule is made immutable.
Otherwise it stays mutable, and any future attempts to change it must start
again at the suggestion stage.</p>

<p><em>Why:</em> The immutable rules are the bedrock of agile practices, and should
remain a small, involatile group of rules. If even one individual in our team
thinks this rule is likely to need to change in the future, then it probably
will. Making it harder for our team to react to the changing circumstances
around us is almost always a bad idea.</p>

<h3>An immutable rule can be made mutable</h3>

<p><em>First retrospective:</em> In any retrospective, a suggestion can be raised to
transmute an immutable rule to mutable in the next retrospective. This
suggestion is accepted with a positive majority vote.</p>

<p><em>Second retrospective:</em> Following a successful vote, a proper discussion
happens in the next retrospective with arguments for why the rule needs to be
made mutable (not what it needs to change to, but why it might need to change
at all). After discussion, the team votes.</p>

<p><em>After voting:</em> Only with unanimous consent is the rule is made mutable.
Otherwise it stays immutable, and any future attempts to change it must start
again at the suggestion stage.</p>

<p><em>Why:</em> The immutable rules are the bedrock of agile practices, and should only
be changed with care. Giving people time between retrospectives to reflect on
this change stops knee-jerk reactions to temporary situations. If, after
consideration, even one individual in our team thinks moving away from agile
is a bad idea, then it probably is.</p>

<h2>Hold regular retrospectives</h2>

<p><em>How:</em> At regular intervals, no less frequent than monthly, we will hold a
retrospective. There are various forms a retrospective can take, but each one
should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a chance for each team member to express what has happened, both good and
bad, since they were last in a retrospective</li>
<li>a chance for each team member to propose modifications to the way our team
works</li>
<li>a recap of what the team has done to advance the accepted proposals from
previous retrospectives</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Why:</em> the central core of agile is to be responsive to changing
circumstances, from within the team and externally. We must constantly reflect
and adapt how we work, or we are no longer agile.</p>

<p>This should not suggest we make changes just for the sake of making changes.
It is possible for us to have achieved an equilibrium, but we should always
be wary of that turning into indifference and stagnation.</p>
