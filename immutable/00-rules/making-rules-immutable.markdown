### A mutable rule can be made immutable

*First retrospective:* In any retrospective, a suggestion can be raised to
transmute a mutable rule to immutable in the next retrospective. This
suggestion is accepted with a positive majority vote.

*Second retrospective:* Following a successful vote, a proper discussion
happens in the next retrospective with arguments for why this rule needs to be
protected beyond normal. After discussion, the team votes.

*After voting:* Only with unanimous consent is the rule is made immutable.
Otherwise it stays mutable, and any future attempts to change it must start
again at the suggestion stage.

*Why:* The immutable rules are the bedrock of agile practices, and should
remain a small, involatile group of rules. If even one individual in our team
thinks this rule is likely to need to change in the future, then it probably
will. Making it harder for our team to react to the changing circumstances
around us is almost always a bad idea.
