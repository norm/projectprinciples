### An immutable rule can be made mutable

*First retrospective:* In any retrospective, a suggestion can be raised to
transmute an immutable rule to mutable in the next retrospective. This
suggestion is accepted with a positive majority vote.

*Second retrospective:* Following a successful vote, a proper discussion
happens in the next retrospective with arguments for why the rule needs to be
made mutable (not what it needs to change to, but why it might need to change
at all). After discussion, the team votes.

*After voting:* Only with unanimous consent is the rule is made mutable.
Otherwise it stays immutable, and any future attempts to change it must start
again at the suggestion stage.

*Why:* The immutable rules are the bedrock of agile practices, and should only
be changed with care. Giving people time between retrospectives to reflect on
this change stops knee-jerk reactions to temporary situations. If, after
consideration, even one individual in our team thinks moving away from agile
is a bad idea, then it probably is.
