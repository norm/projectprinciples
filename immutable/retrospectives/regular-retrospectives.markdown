## Hold regular retrospectives

*How:* At regular intervals, no less frequent than monthly, we will hold a
retrospective. There are various forms a retrospective can take, but each one
should include:

* a chance for each team member to express what has happened, both good and
  bad, since they were last in a retrospective
* a chance for each team member to propose modifications to the way our team
  works
* a recap of what the team has done to advance the accepted proposals from
  previous retrospectives

*Why:* the central core of agile is to be responsive to changing
circumstances, from within the team and externally. We must constantly reflect
and adapt how we work, or we are no longer agile.

This should not suggest we make changes just for the sake of making changes.
It is possible for us to have achieved an equilibrium, but we should always
be wary of that turning into indifference and stagnation.
